            Royal enfield Desert Storm as the name suggests comes with sand colored paint.
            The Desert Storm draws inspiration from the World War era, with its bold, macho sand colour scheme. 
            The matt finish paint job, with the Royal Enfield monogram on the tank and the thigh pads, portray 
            the same strength and grit that of a true veteran. The authentic styling features on this ride 
            comprise wide mud guards, an oval tool box, a single spring saddle seat and a unique tail lamp. 
            Besides, there’s also the trademark Royal Enfield tiger lamp that further enhances this bike’s 
            appearance.

           The Royal Enfield Desert Storm 500 is powered by same 500cc single cylinder engine which comes 
           loaded with classic 500 or C5 and the refined engine is added with lots of technological goodies. 
           Its 500cc engine is Unit Construction Engine (UCE) that depends on fuel injection rather than a 
           carburetor. UCE means there is an integrated assembly for gearbox, clutch and the engine, this 
           reduces the friction happening from movable parts and this lowers the transmission losses. 
           To retain its classic look the engine looks borrowed from the post World War II period, but it 
           uses the latest technology. The engine is with electronic fuel injection system that keeps working 
           on to get the best possible mixture of air and fuel depending on ride condition and speed levels. 
           Thus the Royal Enfield Classic 500 is in its best mode at the cruising speed of 100kmph without 
           worrying for fuel efficiency.
