          The updated Royal Enfield Continental GT 650 takes its inspiration from the 1970s era 
          of British motorcycling, with its cast alloy wheels and blacked-out aesthetic. Alongside 
          its classically-styled, ‘50s and ‘60s-inspired predecessors, it recaptures the spirit of 
          the cafe racer culture of the time and that of our own Continental GT 250. With its sculpted 
          tank, eager attitude and tucked-in riding position, it carries all the hallmarks of a traditional 
          café racer, making it perfect for carving up the back roads or having a ton of fun in the city.

          The GT 650 showcases Royal Enfield's legendary parallel twin-cylinder engine, backed with an 
          air/oil-cooled parallel twin configuration. The 648cc engine offers 47 horsepower at 7150 RPM 
          and a maximum of 52 Nm of torque at 5250 RPM. A smooth throttle response throughout the rev 
          range ensures sufficient power to make light work of the city traffic or carve up the corners.
