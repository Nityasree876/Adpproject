            The Royal Enfield Thunderbird is a cruiser style motorcycle produced by Royal Enfield Motors in India.
            The Royal Enfield Thunderbird is known as Royal Enfield Rumbler in export markets.

           The predecessor of the Royal Enfield Thunderbird was the Royal Enfield Lightning 535cc cast iron 4-speed 
           albion gearbox (right side gear shifter) engine, produced from years 2000-2002. Lightning was launched in 
           india in 1997 to 2003.

          The thunderbird was first introduced in 2002 with a 350 cc AVL lean burn aluminium engine and a five-speed 
          gearbox with the gear shifter on the left side. It is also the first Royal Enfield to be fitted with a constant 
          vacuum MIKUNI-UCAL Carburettor in stock condition from the company. Initially manufactured models have 'MIKUNI UCAL' 
          in 3D on the carburettors, while the later generation models were fitted with 'UCAL' carburettors from the company.

          AVL stands for Anstalt f√ºr Verbrennungskraftmaschinen List (German for "Institute for Combustion Engines"), 
          an Austrian-based automotive consulting firm as well as an independent research Institute.
