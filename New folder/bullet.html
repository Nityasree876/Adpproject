            The Royal Enfield Bullet was an overhead valve, single-cylinder, four-stroke motorcycle 
            initially made by Royal Enfield in Redditch, Worcestershire England. It was later produced 
            by Royal Enfield at Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India, a company originally founded by Madras Motors 
            to build Royal Enfield motorcycles under licence in India. The Royal Enfield Bullet has the 
            longest and unchanged production run of any motorcycle having remained continuously in production 
            since 1948. The Bullet marque is even older and has passed 75 years of continuous production. 
            The Royal Enfield and Bullet names were derived from the British company which had been a 
            subcontractor to the Royal Small Arms Factory in Enfield, London.
