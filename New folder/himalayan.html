            Decades of expeditions. Thousands of kilometers of traversing the most challenging terrain. 
            Years of living and evolving with a machine that responds to the mountains. 
            That's how we made the Himalayan 410, our first dual-purpose motorcycle. 
            Here is how it was built to be tough, versatile, and adaptable to all kind of terrain.

            The Himalayan was conceived by CEO Siddhartha Lal, as an adventure touring, or dual sport 
            motorcycle.[2] The Himalayan differs considerably from the other motorcycles offered by Royal 
            Enfield – most of which are various incarnations of the Bullet utilising the same frame and 
            engine – in terms of its chassis and powertrain. Pierre Terblanche, formerly of Ducati and 
            Moto Guzzi among other companies, headed Royal Enfield's design team during development of 
            the Himalayan.
